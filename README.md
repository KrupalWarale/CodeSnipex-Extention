## Usage

### Generate Questions from Web Code

1. Find code on any webpage
2. Select the code snippet you want to learn from
3. Right-click and select "Generate Practice Questions" from the context menu
4. View the generated questions in the popup or side panel

### Generate Questions from Your Code

1. Click the CodeSnipex icon in your browser toolbar

## Question Types

### Syntax MCQs

These questions focus on language syntax, proper code structure, and common coding patterns. They help reinforce your understanding of the programming language's rules and conventions.

### Concept MCQs

These questions assess your understanding of the underlying concepts, design patterns, and purpose of the code. They help you think about the "why" behind code structures.

## Configuration

### AI Model Selection

CodeSnipex supports multiple Gemini AI models:

- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (default)
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite**
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash 8B**

To change models:
1. Click the model indicator in the popup header
2. Select your preferred model from the dropdown

### API Keys

To use CodeSnipex, you need to provide your own Gemini API key:

1. Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/)
2. Open extension settings
3. Enter your API key in the appropriate field

#### Default API Key

 you have to set a default API key directly in the config.js file:

1. Open the `config.js` file in your code editor
2. Find the `DEFAULT_KEY` property for each model:
   ```javascript
   GEMINI_25_FLASH: {
     provider: 'google',
     id: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
     label: '2.5 Flash',
     BASE_URL: 'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models',
     DEFAULT_KEY: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
   },
   ```
3. Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual Gemini API key
4. Save the file and reload the extension in Chrome

This approach is useful for development or when deploying the extension to a team that should share the same API key.

## Privacy

CodeSnipex values your privacy:

- Your code is only sent to Google's Gemini AI service
- API calls are made directly from your browser to Google
- No data is stored on external servers
- Your API keys are stored securely in your browser's local storage
